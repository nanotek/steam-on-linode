Running steam dedicated servers on Linode

# Getting a Steam API Key
Ä°t is possible to run dedicated game servers anonymously, which we will do, but if you'd like to get an API key for your TF2 server then you need a steam account and and request API access from the dev portal.

When you have the API key it is a matter of a curl post to get an auth token for the server:

curl --data "appid=440&key=$SteamApiKey" https://api.steampowered.com/IGameServersService/CreateAccount/v0001/

and you will be greeted with a JSON response (this one is made up of course)

{
	"response": {
		"steamid": "88888888888888888",
		"login_token": "AFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAFAF"
	}

~~~
